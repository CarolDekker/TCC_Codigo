The home has a double-height courtyard, which is full of trees and plants -- this serves as the main focal point of the home. Nestled in a secluded garden, the two-story home rests on a site where a former hospital once stood. Other components include the central courtyard and swimming pool.

Partner at i29, Chris Collaris explains, ""When entering the home, a gradient of light builds up towards the central part of the home. It slowly builds up until you reach the kitchen which is connected to the big central patio. We tried to double the potential of the patio space by stacking two patios partly or completely on top of each other. They are also top down daylight providers without losing the privacy in the spaces on the first floor.""
